# Project: 3D Plotting

## Summary of proposal

  
  

### Why this project?

My open-source journey began with SunPy about 4 months ago, I enjoyed having to look at the visualization capabilities of SunPy and developed a keen interest in visualization while exploring the package and attempting to solve its issues. The efficient usage of python and purposeful open source contribution was the main drive for me.

I have worked with Python as my primary programming language for over 3 years now and have a strong understanding of Python and Pyvista while contributing to SunPy continued to make me better at it.

I have been involved with contributing towards and understanding SunPy with its underlying libraries for about 4 months now which excites and gives me the confidence that I shall be able to complete the given project successfully and according to the required standards.

  

## Project Roadmap and Deliverables

### Synopsis

SunPy has multiple extensive 2D visualization features for plotting Maps. The ability to have to convert these plots into 3D would enhance the capabilities of SunPy visualization.

This project would include adding a separate python package that extends 3D plotting functionality to SunPy, by using **PyVista**. It would also recreate some of the various existing features and overlays that SunPy's GenericMap has in 3D. 
I shall also maintain a blog based on my open-source journey and this project with SunPy.

The entire project is split into 3 major components which include:-


#### 1) Extending Functionality
- The existing code makes use of PyVista for 3D plotting functionality and all of the code for 3D plotting would make use of PyVista itself. Currently, there exists simple functionality for plotting any given `GenericMap` from SunPy to be plotted using Pyvista and this will be the baseline from where I would pick up on.
- As stated by the requirements, moajority of the functionality of a 2D `GenericMap` from SunPy shall be implemented in 3D. It would include the extensions of all the available plotting mechanisms with the approptiate `AstroPy` units.
- The 3D PFSS field lines from Pfsspy shall also be implemented and tested carefully.
- The underlying packages for 3D plotting would have to be listed out and this has to be carefully tested with different versions of the packages to make sure that this works with SunPy.
- There are no bounds defined for 3D plotting capability and adding extra functionality for plotting Astropy's coordinates shall also be implemented.

#### 2) Extensive documentation
- As of SunPy standards, documentation is extremely important. The entire documentation process shall be written using **Sphinx** as SunPy uses it and I've worked with it extensively before.
- Required documentation is a general order from writing the Index file followed by
	- Introduction
	- Installation
	- Description of the package
	- Reference API which includes the class inheritance diagrams and function description required for the code that shall be written
	- Example Gallery
	- Contribution and release history.
- Sphinx's **Autodoc** allows the extensive documentation of classes and functions which makes use of the well-written docstrings in Python to create the required documentation. Therefore relevant docstrings are to be written that highlight the usage of every class and method with its required parameters and function.
- Gallery Examples shall also be written according to the added code depending on how Sphinx interacts with Pyvista.

  

#### 3) Testing and Integration with SunPy and PfssPy

- The entire project shall be tested efficiently wherever necessary.
- Testing shall mainly be performed with **Tox** integrated with Pytest. The project shall be set up using tox according to SunPy's requirements.
- The appropriate 3D testing methodology shall also be researched and decided on.
- Once tested, benchmark tests shall also be performed to understand the computation required for vizualisation.

___

#### Coding Period Begins

___

  

#### Week 3

- Get started on working with the code documentation of the existing code. I have already gotten started on writing the docstrings and examples for plotting here.
- Begin with the setting up of documentation via Sphinx and gain information regarding the types of testing that are required.
- Gain insight on the level of `PfssPy` extension to 3D and state deliverables with suggestions from mentors.

#### Week 4

- From here on, I shall focus on the extension of the various 2D plotting functionalities into 3D from SunPy.
- I have extended `draw_quadrangle` from SunPy's `GenericMap` to 3D as I had worked on implementing this in 2D for SunPy itself. An example of correctly rendered 2D plot with the right `cpos` :

- Research on transformation of coordinate frames to correctly implement `GenericMaps` in 3D.
- Decide on what classes to be vectored into this package from SunPy, AstroPy and PfssPy.
  
#### Week 5

- First few days of this week shall go into implementing the tox environment with the set up of PyTest and Tox for unit testing.
- I shall also dedicate some time to research more on the 3D figure testing methodology.
- Next, I shall work on structuring the appropriate classes for the package as plots from SunPy as well as PfssPy. 
- The new classes have to be recreated for 3D and this would require vectoring existing code into the new package.
- Begin 2D figure testing by rendering the 3D image in 2D and use `pytest-mpl` for figure testing 3D images in 2D. This will either be done by hashing or image comparison from PyTest-mpl.

#### Week 6

- Continue working towards adding the existing methods of SunPy's `GenericMap` to 3D.
- I have implemented a few 2D plotting functionalities such as `draw_grid` and `draw_limb`.

- Ensuring the extensions are done appropriately with careful comparison from the 2D plots and appropriate tests.
- Research on grid plotting with `WCS axes` in 3D and also research on `clip_interval` of for `vmin/vmax` set-up of the required 3D plots.
- Implementation the plotting coordinates of various `Astropy` units and also drawing of `Great Arc` and `heliographic longitude and latitude lines` in 3D.
